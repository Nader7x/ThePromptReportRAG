# Docker Build and Test Fix

## Problem

The Docker build and test workflow was failing because:

1. **Missing `load: true` parameter**: The production image build step was missing the `load: true` parameter, so images weren't available locally for testing.

2. **Multi-platform vs Local Testing Conflict**: When using multi-platform builds (`linux/amd64,linux/arm64`) with `load: true`, Docker Buildx fails because you can't load multi-platform images into the local registry.

3. **Image Not Found Error**: The test step was looking for images that weren't available locally, causing tests to fail with "Image not found in local registry" errors.

## Root Cause

- Docker Buildx can build for multiple platforms and push to registry, OR it can build for single platform and load locally, but not both simultaneously.
- The workflow was trying to do multi-platform builds while also loading for local testing.
- Production image build was missing the `load` parameter entirely.

## Solution

Implemented a dual-build approach:

### 1. Multi-Platform Build and Push

```yaml
- name: üèóÔ∏è Build and push Docker image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .
    platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
    push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
    tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
    labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

### 2. Local Test Build

```yaml
- name: üèóÔ∏è Build local test image
  if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .
    platforms: linux/amd64
    push: false
    tags: test-image:latest
    load: true # Load image into local registry for testing
    cache-from: type=gha
```

### 3. Updated Test Step

```yaml
- name: üß™ Test Docker image
  if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
  run: |
    # Use the local test image
    IMAGE_TAG="test-image:latest"

    # Verify image exists
    if ! docker images | grep -q "test-image"; then
      echo "‚ùå Image not found in local registry"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### 4. CI/CD Workflow Fix

Fixed the CI/CD workflow to properly build and test Docker images:

```yaml
- name: üèóÔ∏è Build Docker image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .
    push: false
    tags: enhanced-rag:test
    load: true # Load image into local registry for testing
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max

- name: üß™ Test Docker container
  run: |
    # Comprehensive testing with health checks
    # Includes container startup verification and API health checks
```

## Benefits

1. **Multi-Platform Support**: Main build creates images for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.
2. **Local Testing**: Separate single-platform build allows local testing without conflicts.
3. **Cache Efficiency**: Both builds use GitHub Actions cache for faster builds.
4. **Reliability**: Tests now consistently find the local test image.

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` - Added local test build step and updated test logic
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Fixed Docker build test with proper image loading and improved health checks

## Testing

To verify this fix:

1. Push changes to main branch
2. Check GitHub Actions workflow run
3. Verify both multi-platform and local test builds succeed
4. Confirm test step finds and tests the local image

## Before vs After

**Before**: Single build trying to do multi-platform + local loading (impossible)
**After**: Dual builds - one for production (multi-platform), one for testing (local)

This ensures robust Docker image building, testing, and deployment while maintaining platform compatibility.
