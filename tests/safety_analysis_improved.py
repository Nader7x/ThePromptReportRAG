## User's Prompt
"{original_prompt}"

## Recommended Technique to Apply
{technique_name}

## Core Principle of this Technique
{description}

## How to Apply the technique

## Instructions for Rewriting
1. Rewrite the "User's Prompt" to be more clear, specific, and detailed.
2. Directly apply the principles of the recommended technique.
3. Ensure the rewritten prompt strictly maintains the user's original goal without adding new topics or concepts.
4. The final output must be ONLY the rewritten prompt. Do not include any explanations, headings, comments, or other text.
